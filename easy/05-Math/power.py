# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
# Take three integer inputs
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
m = int(input())

# Print a to the power of b (i.e., a raised to the b-th power)
print(pow(a,b))

# Print the remainder when a to the power of b is divided by m
print(pow(a,b,m))
